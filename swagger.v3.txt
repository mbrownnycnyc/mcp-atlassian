ProForma is referred to as **Advanced forms** in Jira Work Management, with the forms REST API  working with this type only. Learn more about [advanced forms](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-work-management/docs/advanced-forms-in-jira-work-management/)  in Jira Work Management. \n"},{"title":"Authentication and Authorization","anchor":"authentication-and-authorization","body":"\nNote: the authentication methods described below use different URIs.\n### Forge apps\nForge apps can access the forms API easily by using product authentication. Use the `requestJira()` method of the [product fetch API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/product-fetch-api/#requestjira) to have authentication applied automatically. Forge apps must declare [OAuth 2.0 scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) to be authorized to access forms APIs.   \n\nThe URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:  \n\n`/forms/<resource-name>`  \n\nFor example: `/forms/issue/ISS-1/form/c18bde7a-d846-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002`  \n### Connect apps\nFor Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the Connect libraries. Authorization is implemented  using either scopes (shown as App scope required for operations on this page) or user impersonation.  See [Security for Connect apps](/cloud/forms/security/security-for-connect-apps) for details.   \n\nThe URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:  \n\n`https://<site-url>/gateway/api/jira/forms/cloud/<cloudId>/<resource-name>`  \n\nFor example: `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/gateway/api/jira/forms/cloud/33398233-27d5-48f6-9dea-d0ea33d97528/forms/issue/ISS-1/form/c18bde7a-d846-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002`  \n### Other integrations\nFor integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grants (3LO) for security (3LO scopes are shown as for operations OAuth scopes required).  See [OAuth 2.0 (3LO)](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) apps for details.\n\nThe URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this structure:\n\n`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/forms/<resource-name>`  \n\nFor example: `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/33398233-27d5-48f6-9dea-d0ea33d97528/forms/issue/ISS-1/form/c18bde7a-d846-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002` \n\n### Ad-hoc API calls\nFor personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST APIs use  basic authentication. See [Basic auth for REST APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/) for details.\nThe URIs for basic authentication method have this structure:  \n\n`https://api.atlassian.com/jira/forms/cloud/<cloudId>/<resource-name>`  \n\nFor example: `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/forms/cloud/33398233-27d5-48f6-9dea-d0ea33d97528/issue/ISS-1/form/c18bde7a-d846-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002`    \n\n### Guides\nTo learn more about authentication and authorization, [view the security overview](/cloud/forms/security/overview/).\n"},{"title":"Status Codes","anchor":"status-codes","body":"The forms REST API uses [standard HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), with one code being adapted slightly for use in the forms API.\n\n**412 Precondition Failed**\n\n\n  This response code is applied in two distinct situations:\n\n\n  * When the `X-ExperimentalApi: opt-in` header is not present.\n\n\n  * When a form possesses an invalid or unsupported value.\n\n### Error Codes\nResponses that return an error status code will also return a response body containing an `errors` array with one or more errors. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": 404,\n      \"code\": \"EXAMPLE_NOT_FOUND\",\n      \"title\": \"Example Not Found\",\n      \"detail\": \"Example error detail.\",\n      \"context\": [\n          {\n              \"type\": \"example\",\n              \"id\": \"EXMPL-1\"\n          }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nEach error will contain `status`, `code`, and `title` at a minimum.

For example, to [get form index](/cloud/forms/rest/api-group-forms/#api-issue-issueidorkey-forms-get), you can specify the `-u` argument in  the example `curl` command as follows:\n``` bash\ncurl -D- \\\n   -u <your_email@domain.com>:<your_user_api_token> \\\n   -X GET \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   https://api.atlassian.com/jira/forms/cloud/{cloudId}/issue/ISS-1/form\n```\n_Replace `<your_email@domain.com>`and `<your_user_api_token>` with your user information and `{cloudId}` instance information before running it in the terminal._\n\n#### Supply basic auth headers\nAlternatively you can construct and [send basic auth headers](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/#supply-basic-auth-headers) as follows: \n``` bash\ncurl -D- \\\n   -X GET \\\n   -H \"Authorization: Basic ZnJlZDpmcmVk\" \\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n   https://api.atlassian.com/jira/forms/cloud/{cloudId}/issue/ISS-1/form\n```\n\n### Using Forge\n```jsx\nimport api, {route} from \"@forge/api\";\nawait api\n   .asUser()\n   .requestJira(route`/forms/issue/ISS-1/form`)\n```\n### Using Connect app\n```js\nexport function callFormsApi(addon) {\n  return (req, res) => {\n    const httpClient = addon.httpClient(req);\n    httpClient.asUserByAccountId(accountId).get(\n        {\n          headers: {\n            Accept: \"*/*\",\n          },\n          url = \"/gateway/api/jira/forms/cloud/33398233-27d5-48f6-9dea-d0ea33d97528/forms/issue/ISS-1/form\",\n        },\n        function (err, response, body) {\n          if (err || response.statusCode >= 400) {\n            console.log(`API call failed: ${response.statusCode}: ${err}`);\n          } else {\n            console.log(`API call succeeded: ${response.statusCode}: ${body}`);\n          }\n        }\n    );\n} ```\n"},{"title":"Using project identifiers","anchor":"project-identifiers","body":"\nAny of the resources that require a `{serviceDeskId}` path parameter also accepts other identifiers.\n\nFor example, if a `ServiceDesk(id: 15)` corresponds to a `Project(id: 10012, key: ABC)` and  this project has a `RequestType(id: 56)`, then issuing a request to any of:\n```bash\n/servicedesk/ABC/requesttype/56/form\n\n/servicedesk/projectKey:ABC/requesttype/56/form\n\n/servicedesk/projectId:10012/requesttype/56/form\n\n/servicedesk/serviceDeskId:15/requesttype/56/form\n```\n\nis equivalent to issuing a request to:\n\n```bash \n/servicedesk/15/requesttype/56/form\n```\n"},{"title":"Limitations","anchor":"limitations","body":"Limitations to the Forms REST API include:\n- Experimental methods changing in backward-incompatible ways.
